Description
We're almost done!

Let's add a little more flavor to the game by adding a suggestion to replay the game after the current session ends.

Objectives
The game starts with a menu where a player can choose to either play or exit.
Print Type "play" to play the game, "exit" to quit: and show this message again if the player inputs something else.
If the user chooses to play, the game begins.
Please, make sure that your program's output formatting precisely follows the output formatting in the example. Pay attention to the empty lines between tries and in the end.
Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the output.
